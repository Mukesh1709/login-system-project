# How It Works
HTML Structure:
The index.html file contains the login form with input fields for the username and password, and a submit button.
CSS Styling:
The styles.css file styles the form, including the layout, colors, and responsiveness.
JavaScript Logic:
The script.js file handles the login logic:
It checks if the username and password fields are empty.
It validates the inputs (e.g., checks if the password meets certain criteria).
It displays error messages if the inputs are invalid.
It simulates a successful login if the inputs are valid.
